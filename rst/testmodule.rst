Let's look at the code.  Read the comments as we'll explain as we go.
Note that this is highly verbose because it's intended as an
educational example.  You can write modules a lot shorter than this::

    #!/usr/bin/python

    # import some python modules that we'll use.  These are all
    # available in Python's core

    import datetime
    import sys
    import json
    import os
    import shlex

    # read the argument string from the arguments file
    args_file = sys.argv[1]
    args_data = file(args_file).read()

    # for this module, we're going to do key=value style arguments
    # this is up to each module to decide what it wants, but all
    # core modules besides 'command' and 'shell' take key=value
    # so this is highly recommended

    arguments = shlex.split(args_data)
    for arg in arguments:

        # ignore any arguments without an equals in it
        if arg.find("=") != -1:

            (key, value) = arg.split("=")

            # if setting the time, the key 'time'
            # will contain the value we want to set the time to

            if key == "time":

                # now we'll affect the change.  Many modules
                # will strive to be 'idempotent', meaning they
                # will only make changes when the desired state
                # expressed to the module does not match
                # the current state.  Look at 'service'
                # or 'yum' in the main git tree for an example
                # of how that might look.

                rc = os.system("date -s \"%s\"" % value)

                # always handle all possible errors
                #
                # when returning a failure, include 'failed'
                # in the return data, and explain the failure
                # in 'msg'.  Both of these conventions are
                # required however additional keys and values
                # can be added.

                if rc != 0:
                    print json.dumps({
                        "failed" : True,
                        "msg"    : "failed setting the time"
                    })
                    sys.exit(1)

                # when things do not fail, we do not
                # have any restrictions on what kinds of
                # data are returned, but it's always a
                # good idea to include whether or not
                # a change was made, as that will allow
                # notifiers to be used in playbooks.

                date = str(datetime.datetime.now())
                print json.dumps({
                    "time" : date,
                    "changed" : True
                })
                sys.exit(0)

    # if no parameters are sent, the module may or
    # may not error out, this one will just
    # return the time

    date = str(datetime.datetime.now())
    print json.dumps({
        "time" : date
    })
