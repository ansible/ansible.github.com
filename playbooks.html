<h1>Playbooks<a class="headerlink" href="#playbooks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Playbooks are a completely different way to use ansible and are
particularly awesome.   They are the basis for a really simple
configuration management and multi-machine deployment system,
unlike any that already exist, and
one that is very well suited to deploying complex applications.</p>
<p>Playbooks can declare configurations, but they can also orchestrate steps of
any manual ordered process, even as different steps must bounce back and forth
between sets of machines in particular orders.  They can launch tasks
synchronously or asynchronously.</p>
<p>While you might run the main /usr/bin/ansible program for ad-hoc
tasks, playbooks are more likely to be kept in source control and used
to push out your configuration or assure the configurations of your
remote systems are in spec.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive in and see how they work.  As you go, you may wish to open
the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/ansible/ansible/tree/master/examples/playbooks">github examples directory</a> in
another tab, so you can apply the theory to what things look like in practice.</p>
<div class="section" id="playbook-example">
<h2>Playbook Example<a class="headerlink" href="#playbook-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Playbooks are expressed in YAML format and have a minimum of syntax.
Each playbook is composed of one or more &#8216;plays&#8217; in a list.</p>
<p>By composing a playbook of multiple &#8216;plays&#8217;, it is possible to
orchestrate multi-machine deployments, running certain steps on all
machines in the webservers group, then certain steps on the database
server group, then more commands back on the webservers group, etc.</p>
<p>For starters, here&#8217;s a playbook that contains just one play.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: webservers
  vars:
    http_port: 80
    max_clients: 200
  user: root
  tasks:
  - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
    action: yum pkg=httpd state=latest
  - name: write the apache config file
    action: template src=/srv/httpd.j2 dest=/etc/httpd.conf
    notify:
    - restart apache
  - name: ensure apache is running
    action: service name=httpd state=started
  handlers:
    - name: restart apache
      action: service name=apache state=restarted</pre>
</div>
<p>Below, we&#8217;ll break down what the various features of the playbook language are.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="basics">
<h2>Basics<a class="headerlink" href="#basics" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="hosts-and-users">
<h3>Hosts and Users<a class="headerlink" href="#hosts-and-users" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For each play in a playbook, you get to choose which machines in your infrastructure
to target and what remote user to complete the steps (called tasks) as.</p>
<p>The <cite>hosts</cite> line is a list of one or more groups or host patterns,
separated by colons, as described in the <a class="reference internal" href="patterns.html#patterns"><em>The Inventory File, Patterns, and Groups</em></a>
documentation.  The <cite>user</cite> is just the name of the user account:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: webservers
  user: root</pre>
</div>
<p>Support for running things from sudo is pending.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="vars-section">
<h3>Vars section<a class="headerlink" href="#vars-section" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The <cite>vars</cite> section contains a list of variables and values that can be used in the plays, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: webservers
  users: root
  vars:
     http_port: 80
     van_halen_port: 5150
     other: 'magic'</pre>
</div>
<p>These variables can be used later in the playbook, or on the managed system (in templates), just like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">varname</span> <span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Within playbooks themselves, but not within templates on the remote machines, it&#8217;s also legal
to use nicer shorthand like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>$varname</pre>
</div>
<p>Further, if there are discovered variables about the system (say, if
facter or ohai were installed) these variables bubble up back into the
playbook, and can be used on each system just like explicitly set
variables.</p>
<p>Facter variables are prefixed with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">facter_</span></tt> and Ohai
variables are prefixed with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ohai_</span></tt>.  So for instance, if I wanted
to write the hostname into the /etc/motd file, I could say:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>- name: write the motd
  action: template src=/srv/templates/motd.j2 dest=/etc/motd</pre>
</div>
<p>And in /srv/templates/motd.j2:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>You are logged into {{ facter_hostname }}</pre>
</div>
<p>But we&#8217;re getting ahead of ourselves.  Let&#8217;s talk about tasks.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tasks-list">
<h3>Tasks list<a class="headerlink" href="#tasks-list" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Each play contains a list of tasks.  Tasks are executed in order, one
at a time, against all machines matched by the host pattern,
before moving on to the next task.</p>
<p>Hosts with failed tasks are taken out of the rotation for the entire
playbook.  If things fail, simply correct the playbook file and rerun.</p>
<p>The goal of each task is to execute a module, with very specific arguments.
Variables, as mentioned above, can be used in arguments to modules.</p>
<p>Modules other than <cite>command</cite> are &#8216;idempotent&#8217;, meaning if you run them
again, they will make the changes they are told to make to bring the
system to the desired state.  This makes it very safe to rerun
the same playbook multiple times.  They won&#8217;t change things
unless they have to change things.</p>
<p>Command will actually rerun the same command again,
which is totally ok if the command is something like
&#8216;chmod&#8217; or &#8216;setsebool&#8217;, etc.</p>
<p>Every task must have a name, which is included in the output from
running the playbook.   This is output for humans, so it is
nice to have reasonably good descriptions of each task step.</p>
<p>Here is what a basic task looks like, as with most modules,
the service module takes key=value arguments:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    action: service name=httpd state=running</pre>
</div>
<p>The command module is the one module that just takes a list
of arguments, and doesn&#8217;t use the key=value form.  This makes
it work just like you would expect. Simple:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>tasks:
  - name: disable selinux
    action: command /sbin/setenforce 0</pre>
</div>
<p>Variables can be used in action lines.   Suppose you defined
a variable called &#8216;vhost&#8217; in the &#8216;vars&#8217; section, you could do this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>tasks:
  - name: make a directory
    action: template src=somefile.j2 dest=/etc/httpd/conf.d/$vhost</pre>
</div>
<p>Those same variables are usable in templates, which we&#8217;ll get to later.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="running-operations-on-change">
<h2>Running Operations On Change<a class="headerlink" href="#running-operations-on-change" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As we&#8217;ve mentioned, nearly all modules are written to be &#8216;idempotent&#8217; and can relay  when
they have affected a change on the remote system.   Playbooks recognize this and
have a basic event system that can be used to respond to change.</p>
<p>These &#8216;notify&#8217; actions are triggered at the end of each &#8216;play&#8217; in a playbook, and
trigger only once each.  For instance, multiple resources may indicate
that apache needs to be restarted, but apache will only be bounced once.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example of restarting two services when the contents of a file
change, but only if the file changes:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>- name: template configuration file
  action: template src=template.j2 dest=/etc/foo.conf
  notify:
     - restart memcached
     - restart apache</pre>
</div>
<p>The things listed in the &#8216;notify&#8217; section of a task are called
handlers.</p>
<p>Handlers are lists of tasks, not really any different from regular
tasks, that are referenced by name.  Handlers are what notifiers
notify.  If nothing notifies a handler, it will not run.  Regardless
of how many things notify a handler, it will run only once, after all
of the tasks complete in a particular play.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s an example handlers section:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>handlers:
    - name: restart memcached
      action: service name=memcached state=restarted
    - name: restart apache
      action: service name=apache state=restarted</pre>
</div>
<p>Handlers are best used to restart services and trigger reboots.  You probably
won&#8217;t need them for much else.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Notify handlers are always run in the order written.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="power-tricks">
<h2>Power Tricks<a class="headerlink" href="#power-tricks" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have the basics down, let&#8217;s learn some more advanced
things you can do with playbooks.</p>
<div class="section" id="external-variables-and-sensitive-data">
<h3>External Variables And Sensitive Data<a class="headerlink" href="#external-variables-and-sensitive-data" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s a great idea to keep your playbooks under source control, but
you may wish to make the playbook source public while keeping certain
important variables private.  You can do this by using an external
variables file, or files, just like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: all
  user: root
  vars:
    favcolor: blue
  vars_files:
    - /vars/external_vars.yml
  tasks:
  - name: this is just a placeholder
    action: command /bin/echo foo</pre>
</div>
<p>This removes the risk of sharing sensitive data with others when
sharing your playbook source with them.</p>
<p>The contents of each variables file is a simple YAML dictionary, like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
# in the above example, this would be vars/external_vars.yml
somevar: somevalue
password: magic</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conditional-execution">
<h3>Conditional Execution<a class="headerlink" href="#conditional-execution" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you will want to skip a particular step on a particular host.  This could be something
as simple as not installing a certain package if the operating system is a particular version,
or it could be something like performing some cleanup steps if a filesystem is getting full.</p>
<p>This is easy to do in Ansible, with the <cite>only_if</cite> clause.  This clause can be applied to any task,
and allows usage of variables from anywhere in ansible, either denoted with <cite>$dollar_sign_syntax</cite> or
<cite>{{ braces_syntax }}</cite> and then evaluates them with a Python expression.   Don&#8217;t panic &#8211; it&#8217;s actually
pretty simple.:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>vars:
  favcolor: blue
  is_favcolor_blue: "'$favcolor' == 'blue'"
  is_centos: "'$facter_operatingsystem' == 'CentOS'"
tasks:
  - name: "shutdown if my favorite color is blue"
    action: command /sbin/shutdown -t now
    only_if: '$is_favcolor_blue'</pre>
</div>
<p>Variables from tools like <cite>facter</cite> and <cite>ohai</cite> can be used here, if installed.   As a reminder,
these variables are prefixed, so it&#8217;s <cite>$facter_operatingsystem</cite>, not <cite>$operatingsystem</cite>.  The only_if
expression is actually a tiny small bit of Python, so be sure to quote variables and make something
that evaluates to <cite>True</cite> or <cite>False</cite>.  It is a good idea to use &#8216;vars_files&#8217; instead of &#8216;vars&#8217; to define
all of your conditional expressions in a way that makes them very easy to reuse between plays
and playbooks.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Handlers don&#8217;t support only_if because they don&#8217;t need to.  If a handler is not notified,
it will not run.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="conditional-imports">
<h3>Conditional Imports<a class="headerlink" href="#conditional-imports" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes you will want to do certain things differently in a playbook based on certain criteria.
Having one playbook that works on multiple platforms and OS versions is a good example.</p>
<p>As an example, the name of the Apache package may be different between CentOS and Debian,
but it is easily handled with a minimum of syntax in an Ansible Playbook:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: all
  user: root
  vars_files:
    - "vars/common.yml"
    - [ "vars/$facter_operatingsystem.yml", "vars/os_defaults.yml" ]
  tasks:
  - name: make sure apache is running
    action: service name=$apache state=running</pre>
</div>
<p>As a reminder, the various YAML files contain just keys and values:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
# for vars/CentOS.yml
apache: httpd
somethingelse: 42</pre>
</div>
<p>How does this work?  If the operating system was &#8216;CentOS&#8217;, the first file Ansible would try to import
would be &#8216;vars/CentOS.yml&#8217;, followed up by &#8216;/vars/os_defaults.yml&#8217; if that file
did not exist.   If no files in the list were found, an error would be raised.
On Debian, it would instead first look towards &#8216;vars/Debian.yml&#8217; instead of &#8216;vars/CentOS.yml&#8217;, before
falling back on &#8216;vars/os_defaults.yml&#8217;. Pretty simple.</p>
<p>To use this conditional import feature, you&#8217;ll need facter or ohai installed prior to running the playbook, but
you can of course push this out with Ansible if you like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre># for facter
ansible -m yum -a "pkg=facter ensure=installed"
ansible -m yum -a "pkg=ruby-json ensure=installed"

# for ohai
ansible -m yum -a "pkg=ohai ensure=installed"</pre>
</div>
<p>Ansible&#8217;s approach to configuration &#8211; seperating variables from tasks, keeps your playbooks
from turning into arbitrary code with ugly nested ifs, conditionals, and so on - and results
in more streamlined &amp; auditable configuration rules &#8211; especially because there are a
minimum of decision points to track.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="include-files-and-reuse">
<h3>Include Files And Reuse<a class="headerlink" href="#include-files-and-reuse" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Suppose you want to reuse lists of tasks between plays or playbooks.  You can use
include files to do this.</p>
<p>An include file simply contains a flat list of tasks, like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
# possibly saved as tasks/foo.yml
- name: placeholder foo
  action: command /bin/foo
- name: placeholder bar
  action: command /bin/bar</pre>
</div>
<p>Include directives look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>- tasks:
   - include: tasks/foo.yml</pre>
</div>
<p>Variables passed in can be used in the include files too.  Assume a variable named &#8216;user&#8217;. Using
<cite>jinja2</cite> syntax, anywhere in the included file, you can say:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">{{</span> <span class="n">user</span> <span class="p">}}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I can also pass variables into includes directly.  We might call this a &#8216;parameterized include&#8217;.</p>
<p>For instance, if deploying multiple wordpress instances, I could
contain all of my wordpress tasks in a single wordpress.yml file, and use it like so:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>- tasks:
  - include: wordpress.yml user=timmy
  - include: wordpress.yml user=alice
  - include: wordpress.yml user=bob</pre>
</div>
<p>In addition to the explicitly passed in parameters, all variables from
the vars section are also available for use here as well.  Variables that bubble
up from tools like facter and ohai are not usable here though &#8211; but they ARE available for use
inside &#8216;action&#8217; lines and in templates.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Include statements are only usable from the top level
playbook file.  This means includes can not include other
includes.</p>
</div>
<p>Includes can also be used in the &#8216;handlers&#8217; section, for instance, if you
want to define how to restart apache, you only have to do that once for all
of your playbooks.  You might make a notifiers.yaml that looked like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>----
# this might be in a file like handlers/handlers.yml
- name: restart apache
  action: service name=apache state=restarted</pre>
</div>
<p>And in your main playbook file, just include it like so, at the bottom
of a play:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>handlers:
  - include: handlers/handlers.yml</pre>
</div>
<p>You can mix in includes along with your regular non-included tasks and handlers.</p>
<p>Note that you can not conditionally path the location to an include file, like you can
with &#8216;vars_files&#8217;.  If you find yourself needing to do this, consider how you can
restructure your playbook to be more class/role oriented.</p>

<h3>Using Includes To Assign Classes of Systems<a class="headerlink" href="#using-includes-to-assign-classes-of-systems" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Include files are really powerful when used to reuse logic between playbooks.  You
could imagine a playbook describing your entire infrastructure like
this, in a list of just a few plays:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: atlanta-webservers
  vars:
    datacenter: atlanta
  tasks:
  - include: tasks/base.yml
  - include: tasks/webservers.yml database=db.atlanta.com
  handlers:
    - include: handlers/common.yml
- hosts: atlanta-dbservers
  vars:
    datacenter: atlanta
  tasks:
  - include: tasks/base.yml
  - include: tasks/dbservers.yml
  handlers:
    - include: handlers/common.yml</pre>
</div>
<p>There is one (or more) play defined for each group of systems, and
each play maps each group to several includes.  These includes represent
&#8216;class definitions&#8217;, telling the systems what they are supposed to do or be.
In the above example, all hosts get the base configuration first and further
customize it depending on what class or nature of machines they are.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Playbooks do not always have to be declarative; you can do something
similar to model a push process for a multi-tier web application.  This is
actually one of the things playbooks were invented to do.</p>

<div class="section" id="asynchronous-actions-and-polling">
<h3>Asynchronous Actions and Polling<a class="headerlink" href="#asynchronous-actions-and-polling" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>By default tasks in playbooks block, meaning the connections stay open
until the task is done on each node.  If executing playbooks with
a small parallelism value (aka <cite>&#8211;forks</cite>), you may wish that long
running operations can go faster.  The easiest way to do this is
to kick them off all at once and then poll until they are done.</p>
<p>You will also want to use asynchronous mode on very long running
operations that might be subject to timeout.</p>
<p>To launch a task asynchronously, specify it&#8217;s maximum runtime
and how frequently you would like to poll for status.  The default
poll value is 10 seconds if you do not specify a value for <cite>poll</cite>:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: all
  user: root
  tasks:
  - name: simulate long running op (15 sec), wait for up to 45, poll every 5
    action: command /bin/sleep 15
    async: 45
    poll: 5</pre>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">There is no default for the async time limit.  If you leave off the
&#8216;async&#8217; keyword, the task runs synchronously, which is Ansible&#8217;s
default.</p>
</div>
<p>Alternatively, if you do not need to wait on the task to complete, you may
&#8220;fire and forget&#8221; by specifying a poll value of 0:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>---
- hosts: all
  user: root
  tasks:
  - name: simulate long running op, allow to run for 45, fire and forget
    action: command /bin/sleep 15
    async: 45
    poll: 0</pre>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">You shouldn&#8217;t &#8220;fire and forget&#8221; with operations that require
exclusive locks, such as yum transactions, if you expect to run other
commands later in the playbook against those same resources.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Using a higher value for <cite>&#8211;forks</cite> will result in kicking off asynchronous
tasks even faster.  This also increases the efficiency of polling.</p>
