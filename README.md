Homepage and documentation source for the Ansible
=================================================

This project hosts the source behind [ansible.github.com](http://ansible.github.com)

Contributions to the documentation are welcome.  To make changes, submit a pull request
that changes the restructured text files in the "rst/" directory only, and Michael can
do a docs build and push the static files.

If you do not want to learn RST format (ReStructured Text), you can also file issues
on the documentation project. 

If you are using ansible at your company or software project, additions to the "Who Uses
Ansible" page are welcome.  Email Michael at the address below to be added.

Dependencies
============

Jinja2 and Sphinx are required to build this site.
